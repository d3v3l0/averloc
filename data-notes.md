# Notes on Data

It is a tab separated file (*.tsv).

It is uploaded to dropbox (should have emails w/ link to folder).

Steps:

1. Script to trim/pad the AST and Tokenized columns.

2. Vocabulary considerations (for the tokenized version we probably don't want to keep every unique token).

3. Split into train/val/test
